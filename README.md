<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is the **dream-funding** Capstone project where users are able to donate to selfish causes from other users. The idea is based on GoFundMe but with a little twist. I was required to create a grouping system to showcase my Rails skills in this final project.
